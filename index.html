<h1>{{ "RETRO HORROR ACTION" }}</h1>

<p>Shift into <strong>Project GHOST</strong>—a suffocating blend of futuristic watchdogs and unchained dread.</p>

<p>A third-person action-horror experience where paranormal search-and-rescue collides with brutal combat.<br><br>  
  
As the rookie operative of a <strong>clandestine pararescue unit</strong>, you'll harness the power of nightmares to drag the lost from the brink and carve a blood-stained path through oblivion.<br><br>  

With bold cel-shaded visuals inspired by retrofuturism, comics, and folklore, plunge headfirst into a hauntingly vibrant yet decaying world where every shadow hungers.<br><br>   
Hope is fading—<strong><em>are you worth what's left?</em></strong></p>
