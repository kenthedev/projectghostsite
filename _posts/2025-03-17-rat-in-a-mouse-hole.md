Welcome to the first of Project GHOST’s Datalogs. It took a lot of digging to get here.

This is a passion project inspired by a lot of things—games, films, stories, yet above all else, it's driven by a dream.
In pursuit of it, I've been fortunate to learn from and work alongside a ton of talented people. And somehow that's been slowly coming together
in the form of a brutal, high-stakes hunt; where every fight is a desperate push against the impossible, dragging you deeper into something 
you shouldn't understand.

It’s taken a lot of time to shape this vision. Learning to focus my scope and goals has been a brutal process. Preplanning and experimenting taking lots of twists and turns, 
as I've sorted out exactly *what I want* and ***what I can actually do***, finding out the hard way to balance ambition with reality. But game development is a process of trial and error,
and I'm just here to push forward.

At its core, Project GHOST is sci-fi action horror. A desire to blend the thrills of pararescue with brutal, high-speed combat. It’s an underdog story wrapped in mystery, where guilt and survival fuel a fight for redemption. It’s government intrigue, rescue ops, and nightmares made flesh. A mission-driven gauntlet of grunge, mysticism, and gunslinging combat, where you're the last thing standing between humanity and oblivion. 

**So why not fight with everything you've got?**

In the coming logs, I'll be sharing more on my goals, progress, challenges, and the occasional minor narrative element or two.

*Until then.*
