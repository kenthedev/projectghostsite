Welcome to the first of Project GHOSTâ€™s Datalogs.

This is a passion project inspired by a lot of things, but above all else, it's driven by a dream.
In pursuit of it, I've been fortunate to learn from and work alongside a ton of talented people.

Learning to focus my scope and vision has been a brutal process. Its direction taken a lot of twists and turns, 
as I've sorted out *what I want* and ***what I can actually do***. But at the end of the day, gamedev is a process of trial and error.

In the coming logs, I'll be sharing info on my goals for core mechanics, features, gameplay, and minor narrative elements I'm working toward.

*Until next time.*
